# Navigation and Keybindings

This page focuses on the TUI layout, movement, pane control, search, and command invocation.

## Interface Layout

The TUI is organised into six panes:

| Pane | Key | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Worktree List | `1` | All Git worktrees with branch, note markers, and status indicators |
| Status / CI | `2` | PR/MR info, CI check results, divergence status, and notes preview |
| Git Status | `3` | Changed files in the selected worktree (collapsible tree view) |
| Commit Log | `4` | Commit history for the selected branch |
| Notes | `5` | Per-worktree notes (visible only when a note exists) |
| Agent Sessions | `6` | Open Claude and pi sessions attached to the selected worktree by default; historical sessions can be revealed on demand |

### Layout Modes

Press `L` to toggle between two layout arrangements:

- **Default layout** — worktree list on the left, agent sessions and notes stacked beneath it when present, detail panes stacked on the right
- **Top layout** — alternative arrangement with worktrees at the top, optional agent sessions and notes rows beneath, and detail panes along the bottom

### Zoom Mode

Press `=` to toggle zoom for the focused pane, expanding it to fill the entire screen. Pressing the number key for an already-focused pane also toggles zoom.

## Global Navigation

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `j`, `k` | Move selection up/down |
| `Tab`, `]` | Next pane |
| `[` | Previous pane |
| `h`, `l` | Shrink / Grow worktree pane |
| `Home`, `End` | Jump to first/last item |
| `q` | Quit |
| `?` | Help |

## Pane Focus and Layout

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `1`..`6` | Focus specific panes |
| `=` | Toggle zoom for focused pane |
| `L` | Toggle layout (`default` / `top`) |

Agent Sessions is the final pane in the Tab cycle when visible, even though it is rendered above Notes.
By default the pane shows only sessions with a live Claude/pi process match; press `A` in the pane to include offline history, and press `6` to reveal historical matches when nothing is currently open.

## Pane-Specific Actions

### Worktree Pane

- `Enter` — jump to selected worktree (exits LazyWorktree and outputs the path)
- `s` — cycle sort mode: Path, Last Active (commit date), Last Switched (access time)
- `e` — edit worktree metadata for the selected worktree (description, colour, notes, icon, tags)
- Command palette only: **Set worktree colour** (picker plus `Custom…` for hex, supported named colours, or 256 indices)
- Command palette only: **Worktree notes** and **Set worktree icon** remain available without default direct shortcuts
- Command palette only: **Set worktree tags** (type labels separated by commas, e.g. "bug,frontend,urgent", and toggle existing tags in the same editor; displayed as coloured badges after the worktree name, shown in the Info pane when present, and included in filter/search)
- Command palette only: **Browse by worktree tags** (lists all existing tags with counts and applies an exact `tag:<name>` worktree filter)

### Git Status Pane

- `Enter` — toggle collapse/expand or show diffs
- `e` — open file in editor
- `s` — stage/unstage files or directories
- `d` — show full diff in pager
- `c` — open the commit screen from the Git Status pane for staged changes
- `Ctrl+g` — open the commit screen from anywhere; the screen uses a dedicated subject field, `Tab` switches to the body, `Ctrl+o` auto-generates from the staged diff, and `Ctrl+x` opens the draft in the configured editor
- `C` — stage all changes and commit with the git editor
- `Ctrl+←` / `Ctrl+→` — jump between folders

### Commit Pane

- `Enter` — view commit's file tree
- `d` — show full commit diff in pager
- `C` — cherry-pick commit to another worktree
- `Ctrl+j` — move to next commit and open its file tree

Each commit displays a status indicator: `↑` (red) for unpushed commits, `★` (yellow) for commits pushed but not yet in the main branch, or the author's initials when fully merged.

## Search and Filter

| Mode | Key | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Filter | `f` | Filter focused pane list |
| Search | `/` | Incremental search in focused pane |
| Next match | `n` | Move to next search match |
| Previous match | `N` | Move to previous search match |
| Clear | `Esc` | Clear active filter/search |

!!! tip
    Filter mode works across worktrees, files, and commits. Use `Alt+n`/`Alt+p` to navigate matches whilst updating the filter input, or arrow keys to navigate without changing it.

!!! tip
    In the worktree pane, `tag:<name>` applies an exact tag filter. Use **Browse by worktree tags** from the command palette if you do not remember the available labels.

## Command Access

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `F1`, `Ctrl+p`, `:` | Open command palette |
| `!` | Run arbitrary command in selected worktree |
| `g` | Open lazygit |

## Clipboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `y` | Copy context-aware value (path/file/SHA) |
| `Y` | Copy selected worktree branch name |

## Customising Keybindings

The `keybindings:` block in your configuration file uses the same pane-scoped structure as `custom_commands:`. `universal` bindings apply in every pane; pane-specific sections scope bindings to that pane only and override any `universal` binding for the same key.

**Available pane names:** `universal`, `worktrees`, `info`, `status`, `log`, `notes`, `agent_sessions`

**Key formats:** single keys (`e`), modifiers (`ctrl+e`, `alt+t`), special keys (`enter`, `tab`, `esc`, `space`)

Keys defined in `keybindings:` take priority over `custom_commands` and built-in keys. The bound key is also displayed as the shortcut in the command palette.

```yaml
keybindings:
  universal:
    G: lazygit
    F: fetch
  worktrees:
    x: delete
  log:
    d: diff
```

See [Action IDs Reference](../action-ids.md) for the full list of valid action IDs that can be bound.
