# Fonts and Rendering



## Symptom: Strange Characters in UI

If you see boxes, question marks, or garbled glyphs where icons should appear, your terminal font does not include the required glyphs.

### Quick fix

Switch to plain-text icons for now:

```yaml
icon_set: text
```

### Diagnostic steps

1. Test whether your font supports Nerd Font glyphs:
    ```bash
    echo -e "\uf126 \uf09b \ue725"
    ```
2. If the characters render as boxes or question marks, your font lacks the necessary glyphs
3. Install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) (version 3 or later), set it in your terminal profile, and restart the terminal session

!!! note
    LazyWorktree requires Nerd Font **v3** glyphs. Older Nerd Font versions may render some icons incorrectly or not at all. If you already have a Nerd Font installed but icons still look wrong, check the version.

## Symptom: Icons Missing vs Wrong Icon

These are distinct problems with different causes:

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Icons missing entirely (blank spaces) | Font lacks Nerd Font glyphs | Install a Nerd Font v3+ |
| Icons present but wrong glyph shown | Nerd Font v2 installed (codepoint changes in v3) | Upgrade to Nerd Font v3+ |
| Some icons correct, others wrong | Multiple fonts competing (fallback chain) | Set a single Nerd Font as the primary terminal font |

## Symptom: Colours Look Wrong

If colours appear washed out, inverted, or limited to 8/16 colours, your terminal may not support true colour (24-bit).

### Diagnostic steps

1. Check your `$TERM` and `$COLORTERM` environment variables:
    ```bash
    echo "TERM=$TERM  COLORTERM=$COLORTERM"
    ```
2. For true-colour support, `$COLORTERM` should be `truecolor` or `24bit`
3. If `$COLORTERM` is unset, add to your shell profile:
    ```bash
    export COLORTERM=truecolor
    ```
4. Verify true-colour rendering:
    ```bash
    printf '\e[38;2;255;100;0mTruecolor test\e[0m\n'
    ```
    This should appear in orange. If it appears in a different colour or plain white, true-colour is not active.

### Terminal-specific notes

Some terminals require additional configuration for true colour:

- **tmux**: add `set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"` and `set -ag terminal-overrides ",*256col*:Tc"` to `~/.tmux.conf`
- **screen**: true-colour support is limited; consider tmux instead
- **SSH sessions**: ensure the remote `$TERM` is propagated correctly

## Tested Terminal Emulators

These terminals work with LazyWorktree's default icon and colour settings:

| Terminal | Icons | True colour | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| iTerm2 | Yes | Yes | Set Nerd Font in Profiles > Text |
| Alacritty | Yes | Yes | Set font in `alacritty.toml` |
| Kitty | Yes | Yes | Nerd Font symbols built in |
| WezTerm | Yes | Yes | Set font in `wezterm.lua` |
| GNOME Terminal | Yes | Yes | Set Nerd Font in profile preferences |
| Windows Terminal | Yes | Yes | Set font face in `settings.json` |
| macOS Terminal.app | Partial | No | Limited colour support; use iTerm2 or another alternative |

## Theme Readability Checks

If text is hard to read or elements blend into the background:

- Verify contrast in the selected theme
- Test both light and dark mode if your terminal theme changes by context
- Try a high-contrast theme such as `clean-light` or `modern`
